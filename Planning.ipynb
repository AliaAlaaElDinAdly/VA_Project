    "##### Finally,  cluster similar items and show the clustering result. Since you have high-dimensional data, use a dimension reduction technique to reduce the number of dimensions for 2D plotting. Perform clustering on two aggregation levels. First, cluster the aggregated data and let the user interactively select clustering algorithms and its parameter. The goal of this step is to select one cluster in which in a second interactive plot the items that are part of the aggregated cluster are presented and again clustered using an interactive visualization. To realize this, you create a simple overview+detail setup.\n"
