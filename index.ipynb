    "The dataset chosen is the [National Survey on Drug Use and Health 2012](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/34933?q=&paging.rows=25&sortBy=10) which provides measures of the widespread and correlation of drug use in the United States in 2012. Information provided is on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tabacco among members of the United State aging from 12 years and older, including residents of college dormitories, group homes, shelters, rooming houses and civilians swelling on military installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set also includes treatment information and personal/family information like income and health care coverage and many more other data. Questions in survey include age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for different drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.1 Task Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "For our task definition we chose to focus on the below classes only as the data set provided include so many information and branches. Also, we are only interested to know which drug is more likely for people to get addicted to and most importantly at which age range. What is more interesting is that the data set seems big enough for each class to analyzed separately before analyzing the classes correlation.\n",
